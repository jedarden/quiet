# QUIET - Functional Requirements Specification

## 1. System Overview

QUIET (Quick Unwanted-noise Isolation and Elimination Technology) is an AI-powered desktop application that removes background noise from live audio streams in real-time. The system processes microphone input, applies advanced noise cancellation algorithms, and routes the cleaned audio to communication platforms.

## 2. Functional Requirements

### 2.1 Core Audio Processing
- **FR-1**: System shall capture audio input from any available microphone device
- **FR-2**: System shall apply real-time noise cancellation using AI/ML algorithms
- **FR-3**: System shall output processed audio with <20ms latency
- **FR-4**: System shall preserve speech quality while removing background noise
- **FR-5**: System shall handle sample rates of 16kHz, 44.1kHz, and 48kHz

### 2.2 User Interface
- **FR-6**: Application shall provide a desktop GUI for Windows and macOS
- **FR-7**: User shall be able to select input microphone from available devices
- **FR-8**: User shall be able to toggle noise cancellation on/off
- **FR-9**: System shall display real-time waveform of input audio
- **FR-10**: System shall display real-time waveform of processed output audio
- **FR-11**: System shall show noise reduction level indicator

### 2.3 Audio Routing
- **FR-12**: System shall create virtual audio device for output routing
- **FR-13**: Processed audio shall be available to Discord, Slack, Zoom, Google Meet
- **FR-14**: System shall support audio passthrough when denoiser is disabled
- **FR-15**: System shall maintain audio sync between input and output

### 2.4 Performance Monitoring
- **FR-16**: System shall display CPU usage indicator
- **FR-17**: System shall show audio latency in milliseconds
- **FR-18**: System shall indicate when audio dropout occurs

## 3. User Stories

### US-1: Basic Noise Cancellation
**As a** remote worker  
**I want to** remove background noise from my microphone  
**So that** my colleagues can hear me clearly during video calls

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- User can launch the application
- User can select their microphone
- User can enable noise cancellation
- Background noise is significantly reduced
- Speech remains clear and natural

### US-2: Visual Feedback
**As a** user  
**I want to** see visual representation of audio processing  
**So that** I know the system is working correctly

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Input waveform shows raw microphone signal
- Output waveform shows processed signal
- Difference is visually apparent when noise is present

### US-3: Platform Integration
**As a** gamer/professional  
**I want to** use the processed audio in communication apps  
**So that** I don't need to configure each app separately

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Virtual audio device appears in Discord/Zoom/etc.
- Selecting virtual device routes processed audio
- No additional configuration required

## 4. Use Cases

### UC-1: Initial Setup
1. User downloads and installs QUIET
2. User launches application
3. System detects available audio devices
4. User selects preferred microphone
5. System creates virtual audio output device
6. User enables noise cancellation
7. System begins processing audio

### UC-2: Using with Communication Apps
1. User opens Discord/Zoom/Slack/Meet
2. User navigates to audio settings
3. User selects "QUIET Virtual Microphone" as input
4. Communication app receives processed audio
5. Other participants hear noise-free audio

### UC-3: Adjusting Settings
1. User notices too much/little noise reduction
2. User adjusts sensitivity slider
3. System updates processing parameters
4. User hears immediate change in output

## 5. Data Flow

```
Microphone → Audio Capture → Noise Cancellation → Virtual Device → Communication Apps
                ↓                                      ↓
           Input Viz                              Output Viz
```

## 6. Interface Requirements

### 6.1 Main Window
- Microphone selection dropdown
- Enable/Disable toggle button
- Input level meter
- Output level meter
- Input waveform display
- Output waveform display
- CPU usage indicator
- Latency indicator

### 6.2 Settings Panel
- Noise reduction sensitivity slider
- Sample rate selection
- Buffer size adjustment
- Advanced algorithm parameters

## 7. Error Handling

- **EH-1**: Display error if no microphone detected
- **EH-2**: Alert user if virtual device creation fails
- **EH-3**: Warn if CPU usage exceeds 80%
- **EH-4**: Notify if audio dropout occurs
- **EH-5**: Provide fallback to passthrough on algorithm failure
