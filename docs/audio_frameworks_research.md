        // Downsample and draw polyline
    }
};
```

#### Key Techniques

        fftProcessor.performFrequencyOnlyForwardTransform(data);
        // Convert to dB scale
        // Apply smoothing
    }
};
```

#### Implementation Considerations

- **Frequency binning** for display
- **Magnitude scaling** (linear/log)

### 4.3 Real-Time Visualization Performance

#### Optimization Strategies

2. **Frame rate limiting** (30-60 FPS typical)
3. **GPU acceleration** where available
4. **Efficient data structures** (ring buffers)
5. **Level-of-detail** rendering

#### JUCE Visualization Components
- **AudioVisualiserComponent** - Built-in waveform display
- **AudioThumbnail** - For file visualization
- **OpenGLContext** - Hardware acceleration
- **Timer-based updates** - Decoupled from audio

## 5. Recommendations for QUIET Project

### Primary Recommendation: JUCE Framework

Based on the analysis, **JUCE** is the optimal choice for QUIET because:

1. **Complete Solution**: Audio I/O, DSP, and UI in one framework
2. **Audio-Specific Features**: Purpose-built for applications like QUIET
3. **Cross-Platform**: Single codebase for Windows and macOS
4. **Virtual Device Support**: Works seamlessly with VB-Cable and BlackHole
5. **Visualization Tools**: Built-in components for waveforms and spectrum
6. **Performance**: Proven in professional audio applications
7. **Community**: Large community and extensive documentation

### Implementation Architecture

```
QUIET Application
├── JUCE Framework
│   ├── AudioDeviceManager (Device I/O)
│   ├── AudioProcessor (DSP Chain)
│   └── Component (UI Framework)
├── RNNoise (Noise Reduction)
├── Platform Integration
│   ├── Windows: WASAPI + VB-Cable
│   └── macOS: Core Audio + BlackHole
└── Visualizations
    ├── WaveformDisplay (JUCE Component)
    └── SpectrumAnalyzer (JUCE + FFT)
```

### Alternative Approach (If Not Using JUCE)

If avoiding JUCE for licensing or size reasons:

1. **Audio I/O**: PortAudio or RtAudio
2. **UI Framework**: Qt or Dear ImGui
3. **DSP**: Custom implementation or separate library
4. **Visualization**: Custom OpenGL or library like PlotJuggler

This approach would require:
- More integration work
- Careful thread synchronization
- Manual platform handling
- Longer development time

### Virtual Device Strategy

1. **Windows**: VB-Cable as primary, document VAC as alternative
2. **macOS**: BlackHole as primary, built-in aggregate device as fallback
3. **Auto-configuration**: Detect and configure on first run
4. **User guidance**: In-app setup wizard

### Performance Targets

With recommended stack:
- **Audio latency**: 5-10ms processing
- **Virtual device latency**: 7-20ms (Windows), 0ms (macOS)
- **Total system latency**: 12-30ms
- **CPU usage**: 5-15% on modern systems
- **Visualization FPS**: 30-60 FPS

## Conclusion

JUCE provides the most comprehensive solution for QUIET's requirements, offering professional-grade audio capabilities with integrated UI components. Combined with RNNoise for noise reduction and platform virtual audio devices, it enables building a high-quality, low-latency noise cancellation application with minimal additional dependencies.

The framework's maturity, documentation, and use in commercial products make it a low-risk choice that can meet all stated requirements while providing room for future enhancements.
