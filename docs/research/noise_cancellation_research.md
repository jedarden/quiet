## Domain Research

### RNNoise Algorithm Implementation

#### Core Requirements
- **Strict Audio Format**: 48kHz, 16-bit PCM format is mandatory
- **Input**: RAW 16-bit (machine endian) mono PCM files sampled at 48 kHz
- **Architecture**: Uses Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) instead of LSTM for better performance/resource ratio
- **Memory Efficiency**: Weights constrained to +/- 0.5 during training, stored as 8-bit values (85 KB vs 340 KB for 32-bit floats)

#### Performance Characteristics
- Runs ~60x faster than real-time on x86 CPU
- ~7x faster than real-time on Raspberry Pi 3
- Can be optimized 4x further with SIMD (SSE/AVX) instructions

#### Implementation Best Practices
1. **Never use sample rates other than 48kHz** - the model is specifically trained for this
2. **Conservative application** - gradual noise suppression preserves voice quality
3. **VAD parameters**: 
   - VAD Threshold: 50.0%
   - VAD Grace Period: 200ms
   - Retroactive VAD Grace: 0ms
